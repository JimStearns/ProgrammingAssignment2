# makeCacheMatrix: creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


# cacheSolve: compute the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
#
# Parameter check: throw error is the first parameter 'x' is not a CacheMatrix
# object created by makeCacheMatrix().
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
